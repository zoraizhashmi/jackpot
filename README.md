Ok, hear me out. The "nonchalant" youth are constantly blamed for Lakers failure, but no one is paying attention to the real problem. 
The chemistry is messed up. Because the whole Anthony Davis trade situation, all our young players, like Kuz, Ingram, to name a few
basically became pawns for this new guy (aka LeBron) to fit his need for the team. They lack trust for each other. This is why the Lakers
are unsuccessful compared to how they were before LeBron's injury. The seriously need to find a way to make up with each other, gain 
each other's trust, and then we can be the team we were, blowing out Golden State at their home.
